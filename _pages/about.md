I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, advised by [Prof. Seon Joo Kim](https://sites.google.com/site/seonjookim/). I completed my B.S. in computer science at Yonsei University.

👀 My research interests are focused on the exciting fields of computer vision and robot learning, with a particular emphasis on video understanding and its applications.
